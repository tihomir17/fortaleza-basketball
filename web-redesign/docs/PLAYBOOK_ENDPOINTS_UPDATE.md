# Playbook Endpoints Update

## ✅ **Updated to Use Existing Backend Endpoints**

The playbook has been successfully updated to use your existing Django backend endpoints instead of creating new ones.

### **🔄 Changes Made**

#### **1. Updated API Endpoints**
- **Before**: `/playbook/plays/` (new endpoints)
- **After**: `/admin/plays/playdefinition/` (existing endpoints)

#### **2. Updated Category Endpoints**
- **Before**: `/playbook/categories/` (new endpoints)
- **After**: `/admin/plays/playcategory/` (existing endpoints)

#### **3. Files Updated**
- ✅ `src/services/playbook.ts` - Updated all endpoint URLs
- ✅ `src/services/api.ts` - Updated playbook API endpoints
- ✅ `src/services/apiWithFallback.ts` - Updated fallback API endpoints
- ✅ `PLAYBOOK_INTEGRATION_TEST.md` - Updated documentation

### **🎯 Current Endpoint Structure**

```

```

### **🧪 Testing**

1. **Navigate to Playbook** (`/playbook`)
2. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for:
   - `🎯 Loading plays from database...`
   - `✅ Plays fetched successfully from backend`
   - OR: `⚠️ Backend unavailable, using mock plays data` (if backend is down)

3. **Test Features**:
   - ✅ Load plays from existing backend
   - ✅ Filter by category (from `/admin/plays/playcategory/`)
   - ✅ CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - ✅ Drag & drop reordering
   - ✅ Toggle favorites
   - ✅ Duplicate plays

### **🔧 Backend Integration**

The frontend now connects to your existing Django backend:
- **Play Definitions**: `/admin/plays/playdefinition/`
- **Play Categories**: `/admin/plays/playcategory/`

### **📝 Notes**

- **Fallback System**: Still works with mock data if backend is unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user notifications
- **Caching**: localStorage caching for better performance
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

The playbook is now fully integrated with your existing backend endpoints! 🏀✨
