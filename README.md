## Getting Started

To get the full application running, you will need to set up and run both the backend and the frontend projects simultaneously.

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend is a Django API server. It handles the database, business logic, and user authentication.

**[>> Go to Backend README for setup instructions](./backend/README.md)**

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a Flutter application. It provides the user interface for interacting with the data from the backend.

**[>> Go to Frontend README for setup instructions](./frontend/flutter_app/README.md)**
